## Pellets ([deployed on Heroku](http://pellets.herokuapp.com)) ##

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

Product name: Pellets  
  
Idea: Next generation browser hub organizing aspects of your life  
  
Purpose: Organize information even better, to set the groundwork for transition to next generation web interfaces  
  
Technologies: React, Material-UI, Aframe  
_Switching over from Angular to evaluate which framework is more suitable for development. [Angular version](https://github.com/tankwan/pellets "Pellets-Angular")_
  
Target users: People who will be part of next generation web interfaces - i.e. Age 30 and below  
  
Product Vision: Pellets as an abstract representation of content  
  
User feedback: WebVR interface seems useful for organizing things, so prototype app should be inclined towards that
